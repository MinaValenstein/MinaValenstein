- 👋 Hi, I’m @MinaValenstein
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, video games, going for long walks in nature with my GF and dog =)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and how to build APPS with it. Currently in the beginning, but everyone has to start somewhere.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - I am currently trying to get an overview of software development. With my first own project, which will be a shopping assistant, I would like to take the first steps.
